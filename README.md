# Peer-to-peer Car Sharing: A Solution to Traffic Congestion

Traffic congestion has become a major concern in today’s society, and figuring out the best way to tackle this issue still remains a big challenge. A solution to combat it is presented in this thesis which focuses on the development of a mobile application centered around the concept of ’Peer-to-peer car sharing’. The application aims to provide a platform where individuals can share their personal vehicles for rental purposes, therefore optimizing existing transportation resources and reducing the number of cars on the road. The mobile application utilizes modern technologies and user-friendly interfaces in order to create a smooth interaction within the ’sharing’ community. By exploiting the power of smartphones connectivity and location services, users can easily find the most suitable car for their preferences.

# Architecture of Peer-to-peer Car Sharing Mobile Application

The architecture of a peer-to-peer car sharing mobile application involves several components working together to provide a seamless and efficient user experience. In this case, the application was developed using the Ionic framework for the frontend, while Firebase was utilized as a backend substitute. This choice was made due to the inherent advantages of Firebase, such as its speed, security, and reliability.

It should be mentioned that a small part of the logic involving driving license validation is separately implemented in Python language and accessed with the help of an HTTP POST request.

## Client side

At the core of the application is the Ionic framework, which provides a platform-independent method for developing mobile applications with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ionic enables the creation of a single Angular codebase that can be deployed on multiple platforms, including iOS and Android, thereby assuring a consistent user experience.

The architecture of this client-side application is organized into services, sub-components, and pages, which provide a structured approach to the development process.

## Server side

In the context of developing a mobile application, the server-side implementation plays a crucial role in ensuring the seamless operation and efficient management of the application’s data. The server-side can be either a traditional back-end server, which is an application that can be written in a range of languages (Java, PHP, Python, Go, etc.), or a back-end as a service (BaaS) platform. The most popular providers when it comes to BaaS are: Google (Firebase), Amazon (AWS Amplify), built.io, etc.
